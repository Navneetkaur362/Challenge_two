            <p id="about">
                My name is Navneet Kaur, studying Computer programming at georgian college.As a student studying
                computer programming, I am deeply passionate about the creation and development of software and
                applications.
                With a strong background in mathematics, logic, and problem-solving, I have spent countless hours
                writing code,
                debugging programs, and exploring new technologies. My motivation to learn and adapt is relentless, as I
                am
                constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow in this dynamic field. I am committed to
                honing my
                skills and expanding my knowledge base. With my dedication and expertise, I am poised to make a
                significant
                impact on the world by creating innovative solutions to complex problems.
                <br>
                My primary education was completed in India and I took science in my high school having strong
                interest in technology. Then i choose computer programming to study in canada because of the ample
                amount of
                opportunities available there.
